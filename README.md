# Red Herring Keyboard

Red Herring is a 75% ortholinear keyboard with staggered columns with a split ergonomic layout similar to an Arisu/Alice.  Here you will find the KiCad files for the PCB and plate, along with Illustrator files for the case and wrist rest.

The PCB features all through-hole components with the diodes laid out in a herringbone pattern that follows the contour of the top row keys. I left a lot of room around the rotary encoder, so it can fit a 48mm diameter knob. And finally, front and center is a 64x128 OLED display.

My excitement for this board stems largely from the ability to use standard keycaps. Whether they're cheap or expensive, as long as your kit has that extra 1.75u shift and a 2u key from the numpad, you're probably good to go. The oversized rotary knob is a bit ridiculous, but I personally find it amusing to look at. And even though it adds a lot of heft to the PCB, I love seeing exposed through-hole components.

## Firmware (Vial):
If you're flashing a brand new MCU, you will need to use an ISP programmer to install a bootloader first.  You will find links to instructions on how to do that in the readme.

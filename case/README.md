# Red Herring Stacked Acrylic Case

![case-wires](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/800930/158737611-4d48b5ed-aa60-4212-9865-cdf9784cfbe9.png)

See the [build guide](/build-guide) for the hardware information and assembly instructions.

The normal case file contains the design for a flat edge case, while the rounded file is the design for rounded edges.  (I've only built the rounded version)

There are a total of 11 layers of acrylic including the feet.  Not the 2 different tops for the rounded version: either a matching color top with clear windows, or the standard clear top.  You only need to print out layer #11 OR #11b and the accompanying windows.  The windows are held in place by friction, so sizing might be a bit tricky.  I also used the natural tappering of the arcylic edges to "lock" the windows in place. It might be possible to use few dabs of acrylic cement (ie. Weld-On #4) to hold it in place, but I have not tried this.

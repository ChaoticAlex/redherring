# Gerber files for [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/)

I've pre-generated these files so that they can be uploaded directly to [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com).  The were generated following [this guide](https://support.jlcpcb.com/article/149-how-to-generate-gerber-and-drill-files-in-kicad) which was written for KiCad 5.

For KiCad 6, I used the following settings in case anyone wanted to generate the files themselves

| File | Description | Thickness | Size
| ---- | ----------- | --------- | ----
| `pcb-gerbers.zip`  | Red Herring PCB | 1.6 mm | 364.4 x 167.2 mm
| `solenoid-gerbers.zip` | Red Herring solenoid edition PCB | 1.6 mm | 364.4 x 167.2 mm
| `plate-gerbers.zip` | Red Herring switch plate (1.2mm) | 1.2 mm | 364.4 x 144.6 mm

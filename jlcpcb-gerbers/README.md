# Gerber files for JLCPCB

I've pre-generated these files so that they can be uploaded directly to [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com).  The were generated following [this guide](https://support.jlcpcb.com/article/149-how-to-generate-gerber-and-drill-files-in-kicad) which was written for KiCad 5.

For KiCad 6, I used the following settings in case anyone wanted to generate the files themselves
